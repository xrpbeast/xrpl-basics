# History of the XRP Ledger

## Origins (2011-2012)

Three engineers - **David Schwartz**, **Jed McCaleb**, and **Arthur Britto** - saw Bitcoin's potential but had concerns about:
- Scalability limitations
- Energy costs of proof-of-work

Development began early 2011. In May 2011, they published ["Bitcoin Without Mining"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10193.0) on Bitcoin forums.

**June 2012**: XRP Ledger launched (originally called "Ripple")

## Why "XRP"?

Follows ISO 4217 currency code standard:
- First 2 chars = country code
- Third char = currency name
- Currencies not issued by a country must start with **X**
- **R**ipple + **P** = **XRP**

## Launch Details

- **100 billion XRP** created at genesis (no mining)
- First 32,569 ledgers lost due to early bug in rippled

## Fun Fact

Arthur Britto contacted FirstLedger to request the delisting of a meme coin created to honor his name. The token ([BRITTO](https://xmagnetic.org/dex/BRITTO+rfxwXDzenkYoXSEbNA4cZjaT9FY3eeL47e_XRP+XRP?network=mainnet)) was meant to spread awareness about him, but he preferred to stay out of the spotlight.
