# Introduction to Xaman

When it comes to building XRPL integrations, one of the first decisions you'll face is: which wallet do I support?

There are a number of excellent wallets within the XRPL ecosystem, and it's a fair concern. Nobody wants to be accused of showing favoritism, and the goal should always be broad compatibility.

That said, **Xaman** (formerly known as XUMM) stands out for one simple, practical reason: it has by far the largest user base among XRPL software wallets.

## Why Start with Xaman?

While every developer should aim to support as many wallets as possible, starting with Xaman makes sense for most projects simply because it gives you access to the largest number of users from day one.

Supporting Xaman first isn't about picking favorites. It's about making your project accessible to the largest audience possible right from the start.

To that end, this entire module is dedicated to Xaman. It's your practical guide to integrating it with your XRPL project.

## What is Xaman?

Xaman is best known as a secure, user-friendly wallet for XRP and XRP tokens, but it's important to understand that it's much more than just a way to send and receive money.

At its core, Xaman is a **fully featured signing application** for the XRP Ledger. This means it supports signing every transaction type available, not just simple payments.

### More Than a Wallet

While many users think of Xaman as a way of storing or transferring funds, it's way more than that. It can sign and authorize the full range of XRPL operations, including:

- Minting NFTs
- Opening or closing payment channels
- Creating escrows
- Setting trust lines
- Account management operations
- Any new transaction types introduced via amendments

Xaman is committed to supporting any new transaction types introduced to the XRP Ledger via the amendments process, and they've done this reliably since launch.

### User Capabilities

From within the Xaman user interface, users can:

- Send payments
- Manage assets
- Adjust account settings
- Sign payloads initiated by third-party websites and apps (like NFT mints)
- Safely interact with new XRPL features as they're released

In other words, Xaman is both a **secure wallet with advanced features** and a **universal XRP Ledger signing tool**, making it the go-to solution for anyone building on or interacting with the XRP Ledger.
