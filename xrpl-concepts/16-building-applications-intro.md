# Building Applications: Introduction

Welcome to Stage 2 of the XRP Ledger Developer journey. In Stage 1, we learned the essential theory. Now we'll concentrate on **building real applications** on the XRP Ledger.

## What We'll Cover

### Querying and Transaction Flow

- How to query the ledger effectively
- Understanding transaction flow from creation to validation
- Handling responses and confirmations

### Types of Integration

- Different approaches to integrating with the XRP Ledger
- When to use each integration pattern
- Best practices for production applications

### Why Wallets Matter

Wallets are critical to the XRPL ecosystem:
- They hold users' keys securely
- They sign transactions on behalf of users
- They provide the trust layer between your app and the user

## Xaman Integration

We'll dive deep into integrating with **Xaman** (formerly XUMM), the XRP Ledger's most popular software wallet.

### What You'll Learn

- **Creating signing flows** - Request user signatures
- **Handling return data** - Securely process signed payloads
- **Transaction confirmations** - Listen for and verify results
- **User experience** - Build flows that feel like modern online payments

## By the End of Stage 2

You'll know how to:

1. Build a real XRP-powered application
2. Create user-trusted transaction flows
3. Integrate with production wallet infrastructure
4. Handle the complete signing and confirmation lifecycle

You'll have hands-on experience with the same tools used across today's XRPL ecosystem.
